<h1>Theee Best Movies According to Khoo</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Megamind</h3>
<p>I honestly believe Megamind is one of the best movies of all time. It's family friendly entails love and a fight between good and evil where evil turns to good to fight evil and wins! and its a really funny movie!</p>

<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>This movie is simply the best. I have no problem repeating this movie every day. It teaches discipline and hard work as well as other traditions the world has forgotten like simply respecting your master.</p>

<h3>Yes Man by Jim Carrey</h3>
<p>Jim Carrey is a Comedy Legend, Most energetic comic that trully left is mark on the entertainment industry and in this movie we get to experience his romance side. But overall a great movie that teaches alot about life when feeling stagnant.</p>
